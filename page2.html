        <h1>Causes of E-Waste</h1>
        
        <p>The rapid increase in electronic waste (e-waste) is primarily driven by the relentless pace of technological advancement and consumerism. As new devices emerge, older models quickly become obsolete, leading to a significant rise in discarded electronics. Factors such as planned obsolescence, where manufacturers intentionally design products with a limited lifespan, exacerbate the problem. Additionally, the growing demand for the latest gadgets fuels a cycle of constant upgrades, further contributing to e-waste accumulation. This situation is compounded by inadequate recycling infrastructure and public awareness, resulting in harmful environmental impacts and the loss of valuable resources embedded in discarded electronics.

        </p>
        
        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of E-Waste</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Advantages</th>
                <th>Disadvantages</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> E-waste contains valuable materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements. 
                    Recycling e-waste can help recover these resources, reducing the need for mining and the associated environmental impact.</td>
                <td><STRONG>Toxic Pollution:</STRONG> Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to the release of hazardous substances like lead, mercury, 
                    and brominated flame retardants into the environment, 
                    contaminating soil and water sources.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><Strong>Reduced Pollution:</Strong>s Proper recycling of e-waste can help prevent toxic materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, from leaching into soil and water systems. This reduces the potential for soil and water pollution.</td>
                <td><STRONG>Landfill Space:</STRONG> E-waste contributes to the growing problem of landfills, which can take up valuable space and lead to further environmental degradation if not managed properly.

                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Energy Savings:</strong> Recycling e-waste often requires less energy than producing new materials from raw sources. 
                    This energy efficiency can lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reduced carbon footprint.</td>
                <td><STRONG>Resource Depletion:</STRONG> Although recycling can recover valuable materials, improper e-waste management may lead to resource depletion if devices are not reused or recycled effectively.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Promotion of Sustainable Practices:</strong> The e-waste recycling industry encourages the development of sustainable waste management practices. 
                    This can promote a circular economy where materials are reused and recycled, reducing overall consumption and waste.</td>
                <td><STRONG>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</STRONG> If e-waste is incinerated or disposed of inappropriately, it can release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and air pollution.</td>
